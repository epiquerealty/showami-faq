# Showami FAQ for Support Staff

## Platform Overview

### What is Showami?
Showami is a two-sided marketplace connecting buyer's agents who need showing assistance with licensed showing agents who can show properties on their behalf. The platform facilitates scheduling, payment, and communication between these parties.

### What are the two main user types?
1. **Buyer's Agents**: Licensed real estate agents who need someone to show properties to their clients
2. **Showing Agents**: Licensed agents who earn money by showing properties for other agents

### What is the typical transaction flow?
1. Buyer's agent creates a showing request (directly or via Client Portal)
2. Showing agents receive notifications and can accept requests
3. Showing is confirmed with listing agent
4. Showing agent meets buyer at property
5. Payment processes 24 hours after showing completion

## Common Support Issues - Billing

### "I was charged after canceling a showing"
**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check cancellation timing:
   - If canceled >2 hours before: They're seeing a pre-authorization, not a charge
   - Pre-authorizations drop off in a few days
   - If canceled between 30 minutes and 2 hours: $20 cancellation fee applies
   - If canceled within 30 minutes: Full showing price is charged
2. Verify the charge type in their account
3. Explain the pre-authorization vs. actual charge difference

### "When will I be charged?"
**Answer**: Credit cards are charged 24 hours after showing completion. Pre-authorization occurs at scheduling.

### "How do I update my credit card?"
**Answer**: Direct to account settings or provide link to payment profile update page.

## Common Support Issues - Account Management

### "My password reset isn't working"
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Confirm they're using the MOST RECENT reset link
2. Check if token expired (7-day limit)
3. Have them check spam/junk folders
4. If seeing "invalid token" error, generate new reset link
5. Remind that older reset links become invalid when new one is requested

### "I need to change my bank account for deposits"
**Answer**: Direct to https://showami.com/users/payment_profile/edit

### "I'm licensed in multiple states"
**Answer**: Platform supports multi-state licensing. Guide them through adding additional state information in their profile.

## Common Support Issues - Scheduling

### "The showing was already taken"
**Resolution**:
1. Explain first-come, first-served system
2. Recommend downloading mobile app for faster notifications
3. Emphasize push notifications are faster than SMS

### "What happens if showing agent doesn't show up?"
**Process**:
1. Issue full refund to buyer's agent
2. Block no-show agent from platform
3. Open investigation into incident
4. Document occurrence for pattern tracking

### "Can we request a specific agent?"
**Answer**: Yes, explain the email-based request system:
- 10-minute exclusive window for existing users
- Email invitation sent to non-users
- Falls to general pool after 10 minutes

## NAR Settlement Related Issues

### "Does Showami require buyer agreements?"
**Answer**: No, Showami doesn't require them. The IAA feature allows agents to disclose agreement status, and showing agents individually decide whether to accept.

### "What is the IAA feature?"
**Answer**: Initiating Agent Acknowledgment - implemented August 1, 2024. Allows buyer's agents to disclose if they have a signed buyer agreement. Showing agents can see this before accepting requests.

### "Should agents add Showami clauses to buyer agreements?"
**Answer**: While not required, agents may want to include language allowing use of assistant agents for showings.
