# Showami FAQ for Real Estate Agents

## Getting Started

### What is Showami?
Showami is a platform that connects buyer's agents with licensed showing agents who can show properties to your clients when you're not available. It helps you maintain your business while ensuring your clients can view properties on their schedule.

### How much does it cost to use Showami?
The average showing costs $50, but you set the price you're willing to pay. Showing agents can accept your offer or counter-propose a different rate.

### Do I need to inform listing agents about using Showami?
Yes, you should inform the seller/listing agent that a fellow real estate agent will be showing the property on your behalf.

### What are the requirements to use Showami as a buyer's agent?
You must be an actively licensed real estate agent in the state where you need showing services.

## Scheduling and Showings

### How does the showing confirmation process work?
Two options:
1. **You handle scheduling**: You contact the listing agent and provide entry information to the showing agent
2. **Showing agent handles scheduling**: They contact the listing agent, confirm the showing, then notify you

### Can I request a specific showing agent?
Yes! Enter the agent's email address when creating a showing request. If they're already on Showami, they get a 10-minute exclusive window to accept. If not, they'll receive an invitation to join.

### What if a showing agent doesn't show up?
This is rare, but if it happens:
- You'll receive a full refund
- The no-show agent will be blocked from the platform
- Showami will investigate the incident

### What if I need to cancel a showing?
- **More than 2 hours before**: No charge
- **Between 30 minutes and 2 hours before**: $20 cancellation fee
- **Within 30 minutes**: Full showing price charged
- Canceled showings within 2 hours are not automatically re-posted

## Payment and Billing

### When is my credit card charged?
Your card is charged 24 hours after the showing is completed. A pre-authorization is placed when you schedule the showing, which drops off after a few days if not processed.

### I canceled a showing but was still charged. Why?
If you canceled more than 2 hours before the showing, you're likely seeing the pre-authorization, not an actual charge. It will drop off your account in a few days.

### How do I change my credit card information?
You can update your payment information at any time through your account settings.

## NAR Settlement and Buyer Agreements

### How does the NAR settlement affect using Showami?
As of August 1, 2024, Showami includes an "Initiating Agent Acknowledgment" (IAA) feature where you can disclose whether you have a signed agreement with your buyer. Showing agents can see this information and choose whether to accept requests.

### Do I need to add a Showami clause to my buyer agreement?
While not required, you may want to include language that allows you to use assistant agents for showings when you're unavailable.

### Is Showami requiring a Buyer Agreement to schedule showings?
No, Showami allows you to disclose your agreement status, but showing agents individually decide whether to accept requests without agreements.

## Protecting Your Clients

### What if a showing agent tries to steal my buyers?
Showami's End User License Agreement explicitly prohibits this. Showing agents cannot contact buyers after showings. Violations should be reported immediately to Showami.

### What information does the showing agent give to buyers?
Showing agents are instructed to direct all questions about contracts, offers, and other business matters back to you. They're there only to facilitate the property viewing.

### Should I have an Exclusive Right to Buy agreement?
Yes, having an Exclusive Right to Buy agreement with your clients provides additional protection and clarity about your relationship.

## Additional Features

### What is the Client Portal?
The Client Portal allows your clients to submit showing requests directly. You maintain control by reviewing and approving/denying each request. Clients submit requests with preferred times and properties, and you decide whether to accept (using a showing agent) or deny (to show yourself).

### What is the Additional Notification Recipients feature?
Platinum members can add multiple email/SMS recipients to receive showing updates. This is useful for team members or administrative assistants. Configure this through Settings > Additional Notification Recipients on the website.

### Is there a mobile app?
Yes, the Showami mobile app provides real-time push notifications for showing updates. Available for both iPhone and Android.

### What are reviews and how do they work?
After each showing, you can review the showing agent's performance. This helps maintain quality standards across the platform.

## Troubleshooting

### My password reset isn't working. What should I do?
- Use only the most recent reset link - older links become invalid
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Reset links expire after 1 week
- If you see "Reset password token is invalid," request a new reset link

### The showing I wanted was already taken. How can I avoid this?
Download the Showami mobile app for instant push notifications. The app is faster than text notifications and gives you a competitive advantage.

### I'm having issues. How do I get help?
Contact Showami support at https://showami.com/contact for assistance with any issues not covered in this FAQ.

## Financial and Tax

### Do showing agents get a share of my commission?
No. Showing agents are paid only the flat fee you set for the showing. They do not receive any portion of your commission if the buyer purchases a property.

### Are there any hidden fees?
No. You pay only the showing fee you set. Showami's platform fee is deducted from what the showing agent receives, not added to your cost.

### Can I get a list of my showing history and costs?
Yes, you can access your complete showing history and associated costs through your account dashboard.

## Legal and Compliance

### Is Showami legal in my state?
Showami operates in states where licensed agents can show properties on behalf of other agents. Check with Showami support for specific state availability.

### Do I need my broker's permission to use Showami?
While not always required, it's recommended to inform your broker about using Showami to ensure compliance with your brokerage's policies.
